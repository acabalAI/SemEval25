This is false. [emphasis, links added]\\n\\nThere is no evidence that climate change made the rain more extreme, instead, evidence indicates that El Ni\\u00f1o and even cloud-seeding may have contributed.\\n\\nBoth the BBC\\u2019s article, \\u201cDeadly Dubai floods made worse by climate change,\\u201d and the one posted by CNN, \\u201cScientists find the fingerprints of climate change on Dubai\\u2019s deadly floods,\\u201d reference a study done by the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group, which claimed that climate change made the rain events 10 to 40 percent more intense than if global warming was not occurring.\\n\\nCNN\\u2019s writer says global warming is the likely driver of heavy rainfall in Dubai \\u201cbecause the atmosphere in a 1.2-degree warmer world can now hold 8.4% more moisture, which is making extreme rain events more intense.\\u201d\\n\\nThese claims are nonsense, and worse, non-scientific, for the simple reason that not only does data not show that heavy rainfall is becoming more intense or common, but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) doesn\\u2019t even claim that any sign whatsoever will even begin to emerge, according to their own projections, until well into the future.\\n\\nAs discussed by meteorologist Anthony Watts in a previous Climate Realism post on the extreme rain in Dubai, the latest claims from the IPCC\\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report show that \\u201cheavy precipitation and pluvial flooding\\u201d has not yet emerged in the current \\u201chistorical period.\\u201d\\n\\nThey have found no climate signal related to heavy rain. (See figure below)\\n\\nEven if there was a climate signal in the broader data, the modeling done by WWA does not reflect real-world conditions and actually proves nothing at all.\\n\\nAgain, several previous posts at Climate Realism (here, here, and here, as samples) have discussed in detail the issues with weather attribution \\u201cscience.\\u201d\\n\\nThe best description of how these attribution studies work was given by statistician Dr. William Briggs in a paper compiled by the Global Warming Policy Foundation. Dr. Briggs wrote:\\n\\nAll attribution studies work around the same basic theme. \\u2026 A model of the climate as it does not exist, but which is claimed to represent what the climate would look like had mankind not \\u2018interfered\\u2019 with it, is run many times. The outputs from these runs is examined for some \\u2018bad\\u2019 or \\u2018extreme\\u2019 event, such as higher temperatures or increased numbers of hurricanes making landfall, or rainfall exceeding some amount. The frequency with which these bad events occur in the model is noted. Next, a model of the climate as it is said to now exist is run many times. This model represents global warming. The frequencies from the same bad events in the model are again noted. The frequencies between the models are then compared. If the model of the current climate has a greater frequency of the bad event than the imaginary (called \\u2018counterfactual\\u2019) climate, the event is said to be caused by global warming, in whole or in part.\\n\\nFundamentally, attribution science cannot be proof of human influences on the weather via climate change because it begins with the assumption that any given weather event is being influenced by climate change.\\n\\nIn other words, the model is designed with the outcome in mind, making it impossible for them to \\u201cdiscover\\u201d anything to the contrary.\\n\\nIn WWA\\u2019s rapidly produced attribution studies the question is never whether climate change contributed to a particular extreme weather event, but rather only, how much additional ferocity it caused.\\n\\nThe WWA models cannot prove that the heavy rain in Dubai, and the resultant flooding, was caused by climate change at all, much less attribute a particular percentage of the rain to climate change.\\n\\nBoth the BBC and CNN grudgingly acknowledge but play down the role El Ni\\u00f1o had in the storms and flooding, even though it is much more likely to be a contributing factor for the heavy rainfall than long-term climate change.\\n\\nEl Ni\\u00f1o has a significant influence on weather patterns around the world, including the United Arab Emirates. A 2016 study found that El Ni\\u00f1o has been associated with extreme rainfall in UAE during multiple years, going back to 1982.\\n\\nAlthough recent reports have seen the government backpedaling on this claim, when the flood stories first broke, a UAE National Center of Meteorology scientist admitted to Bloomberg that cloud-seeding experiments were being run in the days leading up to the storms. This may also have played a role.\\n\\nRemarkably, journalists continue to fall for the attribution modeling con, assuming they are seeking the truth when it comes to the impact of the modest warming of the past century.\\n\\nHowever, if these journalists are instead intended to act as just a mouthpiece for weather attribution propaganda in furtherance of the climate crisis narrative, then they are guilty of knowingly deceiving their audiences who may lack the background knowledge allowing them to recognize that attribution modeling, as currently practiced, is unscientific.\\n\\nIn either case, the BBC and CNN are misleading their readers.\\n\",\n          \"In the Russian Federation are already preparing for defeat in the war: the expert predicted who will be \\u201cappointed\\u201d guilty \\n\\n The expert noted that these processes do not mean that the Russians will begin to withdraw their troops from the territory of Ukraine. The Russian leadership significantly underestimated the ability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to resist the invaders and overestimated the capabilities of their army. Russia has already and is looking for the culprit. \\n\\nThe erroneous \\u201ccalculations\\u201d of the Kremlin were the result of the degradation of the analytical capabilities of almost all power structures that provided information to the top military-political leadership of the Russian Federation. \\n\\n\\u201cWe are talking about the analytical departments of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, that is, the GRU, the analytical department of the FSB, the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation and the like, and subdivisions. That is, there is actually a large data package collected by different departments. And as a result at some point, they began to give their analytical notes with a lot of propaganda elements,\\u201d the observer explained. According to Kovalenko, they became victims of their own propaganda. In Russia, they stopped adequately assessing the situation and began to believe in the possibility of capturing Kyiv \\u201cin three days.\\u201d \\u201cOr they really believed that they could actually capture more than 50% of the territory of Ukraine in a week. It\\u2019s true, they really had faith in this. But as they got involved in this full-scale war, they simply didn\\u2019t can stop, turn back for at least one simple reason \\u2013 then the internal situation will be shaken internally. The question arises \\u2013 why was all this necessary? Why did you start all this?\\u201d added the expert. \\n\\nRussia has already begun looking for someone to blame for the defeat in the war in Ukraine. According to Kovalenko, the \\u201cleaders\\u201d of the so-called \\u201cLPR\\u201d and \\u201cDPR\\u201d, for example, Pushilin, can be blamed for the failures. \\u201cBy the way, such hints are already being heard on their television that it was these characters who put them in such an uncomfortable position, led them into doubt, gave them some incorrect information about the threats, and they were forced to defend the Russian-speaking population of Donbass, referring precisely to these are false statements by the same Pushilin. And such moments are now appearing in the Russian information environment. \\n\\nBut this does not mean that they will withdraw their troops from the territory of Ukraine for this. No, they are simply preparing for defeat in the war, and they are preparing to seek those scapegoats on whom all these accusations will be hung and in general, on whom it will be possible to shove it all, this defeat,\\u201d he concluded. The Russians are preparing for defeat in Ukraine: what is known. \\n\\nPresident of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the Russian occupiers have already lost the war against Ukraine in their thoughts and are internally ready for defeat . In this context, the head of state noted the need to continue pressure on the Russian invaders. In addition, Russia has developed a new training manual on the counteroffensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine . Propagandists were forbidden to say that the operation of the Ukrainian military would be a failure. On the other hand, the Russian pro-government media should focus on the fact that Ukraine receives strong support from Western partners. \",\n          \"Full-Spectrum Psyop: US Whips Up Fear of Russian Bugaboo to \\u2018Subjugate Europe\\u2019 \\n\\nFrom the French president\\u2019s threats to send troops to Ukraine to a series of media reports on alleged Russian plans to invade NATO, anti-Russian hysteria has reached a fever pitch in European capitals. Meanwhile, one world power has been able to sit back and quietly collect the dividends, says veteran foreign affairs observer Gilbert Doctorow.\\n\\nEuropean politicians are doing their best to continue ratcheting up tensions with Moscow, with French President Emmanuel Macron reiterating that he may send thousands of troops to Ukraine, Baltic politicians allying with Paris on the issue, and Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski saying it\\u2019s an \\u201copen secret\\u201d that NATO soldiers are already in the country.\\n\\nBritish and German media have done their part to add fuel the hysteria, citing a recent briefing to Bundestag lawmakers on purported plans by Russia to kick off a \\u201cfull-scale \\u2018land, sea and air\\u2019 war\\u201d with NATO.\\n\\n\\u201cWe hear threats from the Kremlin almost every day\\u2026so we have to take into account that Vladimir Putin might even attack a NATO country one day,\\u201d German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius warned in an interview earlier this year.\\n\\nThis week, Polish President Andrzej Duda claimed it was a matter \\u201cof common sense\\u201d that \\u201cPutin, by putting his economy on a war footing, will have such military might that he will be able to attack NATO.\\u201d Meanwhile, his top general, Polish Armed Forces Chief of Staff Wieslaw Kukula, has alleged that Russia is actively \\u201cpreparing for a conflict,\\u201d and urging Europe to do the same.\\n\\nEurope\\u2019s defenses are in an unenviable state. Facing a major economic downturn and a $61 billion spending shortfall after giving roughly the same amount away to Kiev for NATO\\u2019s proxy war against Russia, European military leaders have warned that they could be left \\u201cthrowing stones\\u201d within hours of a major conflict breaking out as arms and ammo stocks round dry.\\n\\nBut the question no Western officials or media have been able to answer is why Russia \\u2013 which has over the past three decades expressed a preference for economic cooperation with Europe, rather than fighting its western neighbors, would be interested in invading NATO and almost certainly triggering World War III.\\n\\n\\u201cThe whole of NATO cannot fail to understand that Russia has no reason, no interest \\u2013 neither geopolitical, nor economic, nor political, nor military \\u2013 to fight with NATO countries,\\u201d President Putin said in an interview in December, emphasizing that Moscow and the bloc \\u201chave no territorial claims against each other\\u201d and could live peacefully.\\n\\nPuppet Hands at Play\\n\\nThe problem may just be that Russia is taking the hysterical outbursts by NATO officials and Western media at face value, instead of searching for the \\u2018man behind the curtain\\u2019 seeking desperately to keep tensions in place.\\n\\n\\u201cFor the United States, the war in Ukraine has failed as a means of weakening Russia so that they can proceed with preparations to fight China. But it has succeeded spectacularly as a means of subjugating Europe. Washington now firmly has its knees on the neck of Europe,\\u201d veteran international relations and Russian affairs expert Dr. Gilbert Doctorow told Sputnik.\\n\\nEconomically and politically, the US has been able to extract major concessions from the Europeans over the past two years, plucking hundreds of manufacturers from the continent thanks to an energy crisis sparked by the bloc\\u2019s \\u201csuicidal\\u201d decision to cut off Russian energy supplies, forcing the EU to purchase American LNG at four times the cost, and even trying to saddle Brussels with economic and military aid to Ukraine as Congress remains deadlocked over a $61 billion aid package.\\n\\n\\u201cHere in Europe, the war is now being used to whip up popular enthusiasm for war mobilization of the domestic economies and subjugation of the populace to authoritarian and unlimited powers of the ruling elite,\\u201d Doctorow said.\\n\\n27 February 2024, 17:53 GMT\\n\\n\\u201cWhat remains of free speech and other freedoms can be snuffed out in war hysteria. Moreover, the war fever is being used by [European Commission President Ursula] von der Leyen and the EU Commission in a bid to draw more power into Brussels at the expense of the national governments,\\u201d Doctorow warned.\\n\\n\\u201cSome countries are resisting, for example Prime Minister [Mark] Rutte of the Netherlands and even the mealy-mouthed German Chancellor [Olaf Scholz, ed.] are publicly opposed to the proposal of a European debt issuance to finance subsidies to the military production companies, all in spite of van der Leyen. Meanwhile, Macron is on the other side, pushing for greater European centralization for which is the proposed common investment in defense is a nice instrument,\\u201d the observer added.\\n\\nPoking the Bear\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s military buildup \\u201chas been reactive to new challenges from the West,\\u201d Doctorow stressed, pointing out, for example, that \\u201cuntil the decision of Finland and Sweden to join NATO, Russia had almost no troops on its northwest border. Now, in response to new threats from the northern neighbors, that is being rectified by a big military build-up on the Russian side.\\u201d\\n\\nSomething similar can be said of defense budgets, with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute recently estimating that Russia\\u2019s defense budget amounted to $65.9 billion in 2021 \\u2013 a fraction of NATO spending of $1.16 trillion ($753.5 billion of that by the US alone) the same year. Even in 2024, with the proxy war with NATO in Ukraine raging and intensifying, Russia plans to spend the equivalent of $140 billion, still just a fraction of the Western bloc, which has again accounted for more than half of all military spending worldwide this year.\\n\\nUltimately, Dr. Doctorow emphasized, Western governments are following an old playbook.\\n\\n\\u201cAn aggressive foreign policy stand is almost always a convenient way of distracting attention away from domestic failures. And thanks to the boomerang of Western sanctions, European economies are doing very poorly as we go into the June elections\\u201d to the European Parliament, the observer summed up.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
